# NBA Game Highlights Extraction Using Computer Vision

## Executive Summary
The goal of this project is to explore unstructured data and computer vision. I will use a computer vision model to create features from video of NBA games.

## Motivation
I am fascinated with sports analytics and the ability of computer vision models to derive statistics about games and players that are not captured in traditional box scores.

## Data Question
Can I train a model that will be able to select highlights from NBA game footage or derive a new player stat from features extracted from the footage?

## Methods
- fine-tuned pretrained yolov8 model with 3000 labels images of Lebron James playing basketball
- Perform live inference from fine-tuned model on youtube videos via streamlit webapp running locally

## Tools
- yolov8
- google colab
- streamlit
- jupyter
- cv2
- pytorch
- yt-dlp
- supervision

## To run app
- Recommended to create a python environment. I used conda. 
- Install the above tools in your env
- run `streamlit run app.py` in the app directory
- once running, you can paste a youtube video url into the input and see the model perform live inference with confidence level annoations on your video
