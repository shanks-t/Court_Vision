# NBA Game Highlights Extraction Using Computer Vision

## Executive Summary
The goal of this project is to explore unstructured data and computer vision. I will use a computer vision model to create features from video of NBA games.

## Motivation
I am fascinated with sports analytics and the ability of computer vision models to derive statistics about games and players that are not captured in traditional box scores.

## Data Question
Can I train a model that will be able to select highlights from NBA game footage or derive a new player stat from features extracted from the footage?

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
The MVP will involve tuning and training a model that can:
- Take video of NBA games and extract the most important moments (highlights) from that video clip.
- Extract a metric from the video data.

## Schedule (through 6/13/2024)
- **Get the Data**: [Finish date]
- **Clean & Explore the Data**: [Finish date]
- **Create Presentation**: [Finish date]
- **Internal Demos**: 6/8/2024
- **Demo Day**: 6/13/2024

## Data Sources
I am not yet sure where to get unedited game video.

## Known Issues and Challenges
Challenges include:
- Finding enough high-quality videos.
- Familiarizing myself with how to label unstructured data from video games so that I can train a model to recognize the features Iâ€™d like to output.
